        Dogs, an animal humans have been in collaboration with for centuries. 
        Now breed to all different shapes, sizes, and attributes, dogs are truly
        a wonderful species. Dogs stand side by side with humans helping them in a 
        variety of different jobs. They also make amazing companions that often times
        feel as one of the family. Dogs will brighten your day on almost every occasion.
        We love our puppers!
